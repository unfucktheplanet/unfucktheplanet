== Welcome to Backbone Todo's Example

This was a port of http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/examples/todos/index.html originally created by Jérôme Gravel-Niquet.

It was intended to setup the basics for the following:

Backbone with a Rails Todo model.
Jammit for delivering assets and packaging templates.
Handlebars for view templating
   Handlebars helpers (for plural)

I attempted to organize all the assets using Jammit the best I could.  You will see the original todo example broken down
into smaller files in the javascripts/app directory.  I was unable to pull out the AppView, it exists in the application.js file.

If you are new to all this, as I was when I did this little exercise then you should consider running the app and
taking a look at the source using the browser.  There you will see all the files included by Jammit.

To run it you will need to configure your database.  I set it up for postgres, but all you have to change is the Gemfile to change that.
There is no database.yml checked in.  You will need to create that add your database gem to the Gemfile.  Run bundle install, db:migrate and rails server.
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and witness the goodness.
